No one should use it for anything.  
If you do want to use it for some reason you will need to follow Notion instructions [for adding an integration](https://www.notion.so/help/create-integrations-with-the-notion-api) and then give this extension access to the page you want to edit

## Install

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/dmweis/notion-bridge
```
